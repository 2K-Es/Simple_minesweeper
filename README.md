# Simple_minesweeper
Just a basic minesweeper console game using C++

This is for a mini project for our college [OOP lab - CS213]

To play:
Just add the number of mines you would like, then to make a move, input the row and column number.
If you step on a mine its Game Over.
The game will automatically end upon selecting all the cells which aren't mine.
